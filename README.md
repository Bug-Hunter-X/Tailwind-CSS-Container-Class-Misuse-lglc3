# Tailwind CSS Container Class Misuse

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Tailwind CSS's `container` utility class and provides a solution.

The issue arises from misunderstanding how `container` interacts with other classes and screen sizes.  The example shows a container that might not scale responsively or not work as expected due to incorrect application.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation. The container's width may be too restrictive or not resize properly across different screen sizes if not used correctly with responsive modifiers.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct usage, resolving the layout problems.  It may include the use of responsive modifiers or other related Tailwind classes to ensure proper scaling and responsiveness.
